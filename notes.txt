High Level:
- Prisoner's Dilemma 2+ players using gpt3.5 turbo
- Characters current have money currency, can later add intrinsic value to the money in order to maybe affect it's performance
- Can scrape the intrisic value of currency (maybe from reddit idk) to the bots and their reaction towards the money itself in order to get tangibles

- player responses:
     - y
     - n
     - flee (later)

- because context window is finite, i will update the current conversation and 
possibly give updates on the bot's current performance instead
- i also currently give it updates on stats which doesn't really eat more tokens than the first iterations of the game loop
