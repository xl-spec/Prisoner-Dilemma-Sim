- game theory with currency of 2+ players

- currency, i can scrape the intrisic value of currency to the bots and their reaction towards the money itself in order to get tangibles

- player responses:

     - lowball
     - highball
     - flee (later)

- because context window is finite, i will update the current conversation and 
possibly give updates on the bot's current performance instead
- i also currently give it updates on stats which doesn't really eat more tokens than the first iterations of the game loop
